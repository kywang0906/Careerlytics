I love working in the often ambiguous space between the pressures a typical business faces to move faster and stay relevant and useful for its customers while simultaneously protecting customer trust by effectively staying on top of the ever evolving and increasing security threats. I enjoy moving up and down the layers of abstraction, sometimes working at a ten thousand foot level strategy, and sometimes getting deep into a specific problem in a software design, and sometimes somewhere in between. I believe in deeply being transparent about my thoughts opinions to others, and I strive to understand and leverage others' expertise to collectively deliver security outcomes over mid- to longer-terms. I love people who can step back and think about the bigger picture while they continue to deliver tangible, practical, and incremental goodness earlier rather than waiting for perfection later. Currently, I am enjoying learning and helping securing customers of Google Cloud's Data Analytics and AI suite of products and services, such as BigQuery, Dataproc, Pub/Sub, Cloud Composer, DataFlow, BigLake, and DataPlex; and integration of GenAI into these products. Prior, I was at Amazon for 17 years and worked on securing Amazon's customers across their eCommerce services, Payment platforms, AWS/EC2, Amazon Go, Alexa and Devices, and securing Amazon's Generative AI foundation models and hundreds of GenAI applications. I seek to work with talented individuals who possess a positive outlook towards achieving security outcomes. I strongly believe that security is a continuous process, rather than simply a point in time deliverable. As a career individual contributor, I deliver results without authority by incentivizing, experimenting, doing hands-on work, demonstrating value, mentoring, nurturing ideas, influencing, partnering, and effectively communicating pragmatic and balanced approaches. My core technical work has been in the areas of Application Security, Secure Software Architecture, Applied Cryptography, Threat Modeling, Security Monitoring, Risk Analysis, and Data and ML Privacy technology. 25+ years in the industry.[SEP]Experience: Amazon | Greater Seattle Area | 16 years 11 months [EXP] Amazon | Apr 2023 - Mar 2025 2 years | Sr. Principal Security Engineer | Apr 2023 | Mar 2025 | GenAI security principles, prompt injection prevention, training data security, infrastructure security, security benchmarking, threat taxonomy, security guardrails architecture, automated security research, foundation model evaluation, multi-lingual testing, machine-readable threats, privacy-preserving ML, differential privacy, offensive privacy testing, data anonymization standards, engineering mentorship | Greater Seattle Area [EXP] Amazon | Apr 2017 - Apr 2023 6 years 1 month | Principal Security Engineer | Apr 2017 | Apr 2023 | End-to-end encryption, device security, cloud notification encryption, identity signal fusion, data storage minimization, security scanning, sensitive data handling, voice assistant security, threat modeling, DDoS resilience, security champions program | Greater Seattle Area [EXP] Amazon | Nov 2011 - Mar 2017 5 years 5 months | Sr. Security Engineer | Nov 2011 | Mar 2017 | Security Architecture Reviews, Code Reviews, Threat Modeling, Training, Mentoring | Greater Seattle Area [EXP] Amazon.com | May 2008 - Nov 2011 3 years 7 months | Application Security Engineer | May 2008 | Nov 2011 [EXP] Security Software Engineer | Security detection algorithm development, software development, vulnerability research [EXP] Sr. Software Engineer | Software development, testing, on-site deployment and support[SEP]Education: University of North Texas | MS | Computer Science | Research Topic: Cryptographic Protocol Intrusion Detection Published research papers | 2001 | 2003 [EDU] University of Mumbai | BE | Electronics | 1993 | 1997[SEP]Projects: [SEP]Publications[SEP]CertificationsCoursera | Cryptography I[SEP]Courses[SEP]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 3,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]}]}
